## 5. EXAMPLES`
)});
  main.variable(observer()).define(["md"], function(md){return(
md`**Design By Immersion** was very new at the start of the SCRC collaboration, having been presented at [IEEE VIS in Vancouver in November 2019](http://ieeevis.org/year/2019/info/papers-sessions). The [Presentation given at InfoVis 2019 by Kyle Hall](https://vimeo.com/369711296) is available and introduces the ideas nicely in 12 snappy minutes of audio and slides. 
As a consequence examples, other than those given in the paper and upon which the constructs are based, are limited.`
)});
  main.variable(observer()).define(["md"], function(md){return(
md`However, key literature and concepts used in developing the **Design By Immersion** activities include a series of papers that describe this space:
 * The **Nested Model** for Visualization Design and Validation - [Munzner (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.111), describes 4-levels of cascading threats to visualization research validity:
  _problem characterisation_, _task and data abstraction_, _encoding and interaction design_, and _algorithm design_;
 * **Design Study Methodology** - [Sedlmair et al. (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.213) - a process model containing 9 stages to structure engagement and 23 pitfalls to be avoided while doing so. DSM is intended to guide visualization researchers and show the "_iterative dynamics_" of applied visualization design work
 * **Action Design Research** - [McCurdy et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1145/2993901.2993916) - provides a focus on knowledge construction through the co-design of artefacts. These, and associated knowledge, are developed through Building/Intervention/Evaluation loops in which design is used to disrupt (and improve) process. Key concepts include _Reciprocal Shaping_ -- the development of designs and design ideas from complimentary sources; _Mutually Influential Roles_ -- close collaboration that causes shifts in knowledge, practice and approaches to design and problem solving as perspectives are shared and learning occurs.
 * **Risk the Drift!** - [Hinrichs et al. (2017)](http://hdl.handle.net/10023/11778) - which explores theses shifting knowledge spaces and research roles involved in design collaborations between humanities researchers and visualization designers.

These approaches were used to frame much of the SCRC engagement and have been applied and developed in numerous visualization design studies.`

## 6. DESCRIPTION & USE`
)});
  main.variable(observer()).define(["md"], function(md){return(
md`The digital workplace of lockdown with regular video calls, seminars and other online knowledge exchange was effective in enabling
 _Design by Immersion_. Indeed we were required to engage immersively as we sat at home, legally obliged to remain indoors, and connected, worked, analysed and designed through our screens. `
)});
  main.variable(observer()).define(["md"], function(md){return(
md`In _Design by Immersion_ terminology the digital workplace and associated protocols supported our efforts to use visualization effectively, so that we could readily: 

 * #### _**D-3**_ _Analyze data collaboratively with domain experts_<br/>
  all data analysis was digital and cold be screen-shared;
 * #### _**S-1**_ _Observe domain experts practices unobtrusively in situ_<br/>
  data, discussions, demos and explanations were digital and shared;
 * #### _**S-4**_ _Attend meetings and discussions in the domain_ unobtrusively<br/>
   again, this was entirely digital and attendance was unlimited and entirely unobtrusive;
 * #### _**C-4**_ _Translate concepts and material for design team members coming from predominantly visualization or target domain backgrounds_<br/>
   we used the digital workspace to document voraciously, with _GitHub_ and _Zulip_ providing particular focii for resources, discussions and updates;
 * #### _**L-2**_ _Gain broader exposure to domain concepts beyond domain problem_<br/>
   the mass of documentation on all SCRC efforts enabled us to browse and connect to achieve this aim;
 * #### _**L-5**_ _Participate in simulations of domain work_<br/>
   the modelling was all about simulation, and the digital workspace made participation straightforward;
 * #### _**P-3**_ _Start ideating early in the design process using pre-existing domain knowledge_<br/>
   we shared knowledge and perspectives through Zoom calls and live document sharing, commenting, editing ;
 * #### _**P-4**_ _Iterate rapidly and collaboratively on designs by leveraging informal domain feedback_<br/>
   online provided huge capacity for this kind of iterative feedback and critique;
 * #### _**P-5**_ _Self-critique designs from the visualization and domain perspectives_
   as above, we requested and received feedback both in real time and asynchronously in ways that were made possible by the digital workspace and the deep commitment and focus that the pandemic generated.

Epidemiological modellers and visualization experts increased their knowledge about the problem and solution spaces to reduce knowledge gaps and develop inter-disciplinary knowledge.`

This enabled us to share and address data challenges. 

* We prioritised effectively, designing informative visualization that contributed to problem solving, and iterated relatively well in the digital workspace

* We were able to share images and reactions - acquiring and contributing knowledge about the use of visualization in this domain<br/>
  * **P-2** - encodings were inspired by existing visualization created by the modellers;
  * **P-5** - _self-critique_ became constructive _**co**-critique_;

 * **S-1** - _observe domain experts practices unobtrusively in situ_ - became our way of working;
